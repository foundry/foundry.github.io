why is everyone being so _polite_ about this matter?

Facebook’s business is to squeeze every ounce of data out of their users by obvious means or not. Their business model they don’t even see anything wrong with this.

Now their app is exposed as draining battery because it is always-on in the background. Gathering who-knows-what-data about you.

And we and they are calling this a __bug__?

Facebook running a ‘silent audio stream’ is ‘unintentional’?

Why do we give them the benefit of the doubt? Would we do the same for NSA? GCHQ?
